# Change Character App | Beginner Level .Net Core Path [www.patika.dev]

Hello, everyone. In this project, I tried to make an application that replaces the first character with the last character of the given word.

## Example : 

**Input:** Merhaba Hello Algoritma x

**Output:** aerhabM oellH algoritmA x

I wish everyone success. Thank you...
